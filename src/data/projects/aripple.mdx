# Overview

> ARipple -- A Ripple of Your Imagination.

Aripple is a creator-first publishing platform that reimagines how indie artists organize, share, and preserve their work. Inspired by my own journey as a digital comic artist navigating both Western and Asian creator ecosystems, Aripple is a personal and systemic response to the fragmented digital spaces artists inhabit today.

Unlike traditional content feeds, Aripple takes the form of a customizable digital archive â€” think Notion meets AO3 for comics, illustrations, and long-form visual storytelling.

## The Problem

Despite the growing number of creator platforms, none fully serve the needs of bicultural, narrative-driven indie artists:

- <Green>Fragmentation:</Green> Artists must juggle multiple platforms to get the
  full suite of features (e.g. one for visibility, another for monetization, another
  for community).
- <Green>Poor structure for long-form work:</Green> Most sites are built for one-off
  posts, making it difficult to publish and navigate serialized content.
- <Green>Cultural barriers:</Green> Japanese platforms often lack accessibility for
  non-native users; Western sites often feel outdated or overly commercialized.
- <Green>Lack of calm, creative space:</Green> The constant chase for likes and algorithmic
  visibility can be draining and discouraging for artists focused on craft.

    Every platform had one or two great features, but never the full picture. So
    I thought: "Why keep hopping when I can build what we all need?"
