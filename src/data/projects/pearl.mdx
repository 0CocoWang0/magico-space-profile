# Every creation is a pearl

> A community platform blending art, technology, and connection.

## ✨ Overview

Pearl is a web platform where artists can upload, display, and discover multi-media comics and illustrations. I envisioned it as both a gallery and a playground — a space that values creativity, collaboration, and the raw process behind each artwork.

## 🧠 Key Design Insights

1. **User-led discovery**  
   Inspired by Behance + Pinterest, Pearl encourages exploration by showcasing curated and trending works on the homepage.

2. **Creator-first structure**  
   Artist pages are treated like digital portfolios, with customizable themes and post types.

## 💡 Challenges & Learnings

One key challenge was creating a clean UI for artwork uploads that wouldn't overwhelm first-time users. I iterated on multiple wireframes before arriving at a drag-and-drop experience with live preview and tagging.

I also learned how to leverage `getStaticProps` and dynamic routing in Next.js to support scalable case studies like this one.

## 🚧 What's next?

- Add user auth with Clerk or Auth.js
- Build social features (likes, follows, reposts)
- Enable EPUB/PDF-style readers for longform comics

## 🪞 Reflection

Pearl taught me the power of bringing design and dev together. It’s not just about building a product, but crafting a world. ✨
