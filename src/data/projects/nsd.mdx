# Representational Topology Analysis – Research in Farivar Lab

During my research assistantship in Prof. Reza Farivar’s lab at McGill, I worked on applying advanced computational methods to understand how the brain encodes visual information.

My focus was on <Green>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)</Green> and <Green>Representational Topology Analysis (RTA)</Green> using the <Link href="https://naturalscenesdataset.org">Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)</Link>, one
of the largest publicly available fMRI datasets.

# Key Contributions

- Automated data pipelines for Natural Scene Dataset (73,000+ images) analysis using Python, R, AWS and Azure
- Conducted representational topology analysis on 30,000 fMRI beta value entries across 7 brain ROIs
- Visualized results through heatmaps, Vietoris-Rips graphs, and persistence diagrams to test the hypothesis
- Stress-tested pipelines across environments (OS, RAM) and maintained clean, reproducible code in GitHub
- Mentored undergraduate students on dataset workflows and automation systems to support lab scalability
- Selected as student speaker to present findings at the 47th Annual McGill Ophthalmology Research Day
